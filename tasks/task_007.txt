# Task ID: 7
# Title: 결과 이미지 생성 및 공유 기능
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality to generate the final image with rings overlaid on fingers and provide options to download or share via Web Share API.
# Details:
1. Create a function to generate the final image from the canvas:
```typescript
const generateFinalImage = (canvas: HTMLCanvasElement): Promise<Blob> => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    canvas.toBlob(blob => {
      if (blob) {
        resolve(blob);
      } else {
        reject(new Error('Failed to generate image'));
      }
    }, 'image/jpeg', 0.95);
  });
};
```
2. Implement download functionality:
```typescript
const downloadImage = async (canvas: HTMLCanvasElement) => {
  try {
    const blob = await generateFinalImage(canvas);
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    const a = document.createElement('a');
    a.href = url;
    a.download = 'haime-lets-try.jpg';
    document.body.appendChild(a);
    a.click();
    document.body.removeChild(a);
    URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to download image:', error);
  }
};
```
3. Implement Web Share API integration:
```typescript
const shareImage = async (canvas: HTMLCanvasElement) => {
  try {
    if (!navigator.share) {
      throw new Error('Web Share API not supported');
    }
    
    const blob = await generateFinalImage(canvas);
    const file = new File([blob], 'haime-lets-try.jpg', { type: 'image/jpeg' });
    
    await navigator.share({
      title: 'My Ring Try-On from haime',
      text: 'Check out these rings I tried on with haime lets try!',
      files: [file]
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to share image:', error);
    // Fallback to download if sharing fails
    downloadImage(canvas);
  }
};
```
4. Create UI components for download and share buttons
5. Implement a share sheet for platforms without Web Share API support
6. Add visual feedback during image generation and sharing
7. Ensure the final image includes branding elements as specified in the design

# Test Strategy:
1. Test image generation with various ring combinations
2. Verify download functionality works across browsers
3. Test Web Share API on supported platforms
4. Verify fallback mechanisms work on unsupported platforms
5. Test image quality and size optimization
6. Verify that no image data is sent to servers during sharing

# Subtasks:
## 1. 캔버스 렌더링 시스템 구현 [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a canvas-based rendering system for the ring overlay feature
### Details:
Set up an HTML5 canvas element that will be used for rendering the ring overlays. Implement the basic drawing context and initialization functions. Create a rendering loop that can efficiently update the canvas when needed. Include methods for loading and caching ring images to be used as overlays. Establish a basic architecture that separates rendering logic from application logic.

## 2. 합성 위치 알고리즘 개발 [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop algorithms to position ring overlays based on finger detection data
### Details:
Create algorithms that translate finger detection coordinates to canvas coordinates. Implement logic to determine the correct finger joint for ring placement. Add stabilization techniques to reduce jitter in positioning. Develop methods to handle different hand orientations and positions. Include fallback positioning when finger detection confidence is low.

## 3. 스케일/회전 조정 기능 [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Implement dynamic scaling and rotation of ring overlays based on finger orientation
### Details:
Create algorithms to determine appropriate ring scaling based on detected finger width. Implement rotation adjustments that align rings with finger orientation. Add perspective transformations to match the viewing angle of the finger. Develop smooth transitions when scaling or rotating to prevent visual jumps. Include configuration options for different ring styles and their specific scaling requirements.

## 4. 모바일 성능 최적화 [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Enhance rendering performance and implement z-index layering for realistic appearance
### Details:
Implement proper z-index handling to ensure rings appear correctly relative to fingers. Add occlusion handling so rings can appear partially hidden by other fingers when appropriate. Optimize canvas operations for mobile GPU performance. Implement resolution scaling based on device capabilities. Add frame rate throttling for lower-end devices. Create performance monitoring tools to identify and address bottlenecks.
