# Description: Add anonymous usage analytics to track feature usage and user flow without collecting personal data.
# Details:
1. Implement privacy-focused analytics (e.g., Plausible, Simple Analytics)
2. Track key user interactions and flow completion
3. Ensure no personal data or images are included in analytics
4. Add opt-out option for users

Example implementation:
```tsx
// utils/analytics.ts

// Define events we want to track
export enum AnalyticsEvent {
  PAGE_VIEW = 'page_view',
  IMAGE_UPLOAD = 'image_upload',
  FINGER_DETECTION = 'finger_detection',
  RING_SELECTION = 'ring_selection',
  IMAGE_GENERATION = 'image_generation',
  IMAGE_SHARE = 'image_share'
}

// Track an event without personal data
export function trackEvent(event: AnalyticsEvent, properties: Record<string, any> = {}) {
  // Remove any potentially sensitive data
  const safeProperties = { ...properties }
  delete safeProperties.image
  delete safeProperties.imageUrl
  delete safeProperties.fingerPositions
  
  // In a real implementation, you would send this to your analytics service
  console.log('Analytics event:', event, safeProperties)
  
  // Example implementation with a hypothetical analytics service
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.plausible) {
    window.plausible(event, { props: safeProperties })
  }
}

// Hook to track page views
export function usePageViewTracking(pageName: string) {
  useEffect(() => {
    trackEvent(AnalyticsEvent.PAGE_VIEW, { page: pageName })
  }, [pageName])
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify that analytics events are triggered correctly for key user actions. Ensure no personal data or images are included in analytics events. Test the opt-out functionality to ensure it works correctly. Verify that analytics data is useful for understanding user behavior and identifying potential improvements.
