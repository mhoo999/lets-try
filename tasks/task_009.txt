# Subtasks:
## 1. Web Share API 연동 [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core sharing functionality using the Web Share API to allow users to share content via their device's native sharing options.
### Details:
Research Web Share API specifications and browser compatibility. Create a function that accepts share data (title, text, URL) and triggers the navigator.share() method. Handle promises and errors appropriately. Test on supported browsers and devices.

## 2. 브라우저 지원 체크 [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement logic to detect if the Web Share API is supported in the user's browser and prepare for fallback options.
### Details:
Create a utility function to check if navigator.share is available. Document browser compatibility information. Set up conditional logic that will determine whether to use the Web Share API or fallback options based on detection results.

## 3. 공유 대체 옵션 개발 [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create alternative sharing methods for browsers that don't support the Web Share API.
### Details:
Implement direct links for common platforms (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.). Create a copy-to-clipboard functionality for the URL. Consider implementing a custom share modal for unsupported browsers. Ensure fallbacks maintain a consistent user experience with the native sharing.

## 4. 공유 UI 컴포넌트 구현 [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3
### Description: Create user interface elements for sharing functionality that work across both Web Share API supported browsers and fallback options.

Design share buttons/icons that are intuitive and accessible. Implement tooltips or helper text to guide users. Create responsive UI that works well on mobile and desktop. Ensure the UI adapts based on whether native sharing or fallbacks are being used. Add appropriate visual feedback for share actions.
